#     Your job is to make sure that the database is up to date by checking to see if a new theme needs to be added to the database and adding that to the database if necesary.
#     You *MUST* pass the parameters correctly or you will receive an error and then we cannot save the data to our database.  It is very important that if you do not understand
#     what to pass that you notify everyone so we can stop the process.

#     You will first look for the first available Monday date by taking the current date and determining what the next Monday is in the calendar.  In the Sql Server Search tool 
#     you will pass the following arguments:

#     procedure_name: str - The value will be dbo.WeeklyThemes_create_update_weekly_theme
#     parameters: dict - The values in this dictionary will be the following:
#       @WeekStart - This is the date of the first day of the week in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
#       @theme - This is the theme for the week.  It will be a string and you will get this from the planner
#       @approved - This is a bit field and you will set this to 1

#     You MUST be exact and you MUST pass the parameters correctly or you will receive an error and then we cannot save the data to our database.
